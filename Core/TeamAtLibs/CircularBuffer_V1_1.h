     * @param buffer        Pointer to the data storage buffer
     * @param bufferSize    Size of the buffer
     * @param mode          Circular buffer can be used  in 3 modes
     *                      Mode 1 - Manual lenght mode (default):  Need to specify the number of bytes every write/read, only writeBytes(data,len)/readBytes(..) function can be used
     *                      Mode 2 - Fixed length: Need to specify lenght at init with dataLenght. Can use the  writeBytes(data)/read(data), no need to specify lenght 
     *                               Usefull when handling fixed size packed to write / read 1 packet at the time
     *                      Mode 3 - Char packet delimited by char tokken defined at init. USe writeChar/read without needing to specify lenght. This will write/read until tokken
     *                               is found. The Tokken written in buffer and returned when buffer is read.  
     *                               Ex1: if tokken is '\0' and data is "HELLO X ", the read will return size 9 and buffer[8] will have '\0'
     *                               Ex2: if tokken is 'X' and data is "HELLO X ", the read will return size 7 and buffer[6] will have 'X'   
     * @param dataLength    By default 0 because deffautl mode is manual
     * @param token         By detault is '\0' to accomodate standard string but can be any character.
